Create a public class called Cube without a constructor which gets one
single private integer variable Side, a getter GetSide() and a setter
SetSide(int num) method for this property. Actually, getter and setter
methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next
kata of this series, we gonna refactor the code and make it a bit more
professional.

Notes:

    There's no need to check for negative values!
    initialise the side to 0.
