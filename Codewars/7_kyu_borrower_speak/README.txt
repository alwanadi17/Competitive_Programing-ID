The borrowers are tiny tiny fictional people. As tiny tiny people they
have to be sure they aren't spotted, or more importantly, stepped on.

As a result, the borrowers talk very very quietly. They find that
capitals and punctuation of any sort lead them to raise their voices and
put them in danger.

The young borrowers have begged their parents to stop using caps and
punctuation.

Change the input text 's' to new borrower speak. Help save the next
generation!
