In this kata you train your skills in creation of 
Classes.
Handled topics are:
    - constructor,
    - data members,
    - class functions,
    - copy constructor,
    - operator overloading.

The task is simple.
With a help of sample tests you are creating a X() 
class.  X class contains two data members m_a and m_b 
(default values are [1,2].)
After all missing components of the class are 
written, it is expected  that following lines of code 
will be compiled (see Initial Solution).
Have fun on training!

Note:

You'll have to implement all the mentioned in 
"Expected" user cases of the class (see Initial 
Solution) of the class. Until there, you will see 
compiler errors. Don't forget to select how are you 
satisfied with this kata and/or leave your proposals 
or comments.
