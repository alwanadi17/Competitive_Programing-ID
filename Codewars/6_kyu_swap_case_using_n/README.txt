Your job is to change the given string s using a non-negative integer n.

Each bit in n will specify whether or not to swap the case for each alphabetic character in s: if the bit is 1, swap the case; if its 0, leave it as is. When you finish with the last bit of n, start again with the first bit.

You should skip the checking of bits when a non-alphabetic character is encountered, but they should be preserved in their original positions.
Examples

swap("Hello world!", 11)  -->  "heLLO wORLd!"

...because 11 is 1011 in binary, so the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 9th alphabetical characters have to be swapped:

H e l l o   w o r l d !
1 0 1 1 1 x 0 1 1 1 0 x
^   ^ ^ ^    ^ ^ ^

More examples

swap("gOOd MOrniNg", 7864)  -->  "GooD MorNIng"
swap("", 11345)  -->  ""
swap("the lord of the rings", 0)  -->  "the lord of the rings"
