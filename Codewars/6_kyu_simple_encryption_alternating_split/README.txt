Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string S and an integer N concatenates all the odd-indexed characters of S with all the even-indexed characters of S, this process should be repeated N times.

Examples:

encrypt("012345", 1)  =>  "135024"
encrypt("012345", 2)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"
encrypt("012345", 3)  =>  "135024"  ->  "304152"  ->  "012345"

encrypt("01234", 1)  =>  "13024"
encrypt("01234", 2)  =>  "13024"  ->  "32104"
encrypt("01234", 3)  =>  "13024"  ->  "32104"  ->  "20314"

Together with the encryption function, you should also implement a decryption function which reverses the process.

If the string S is an empty value or the integer N is not positive, return the first argument without changes.
